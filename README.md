# Coffee Sales Analysis and Dashboard (Excel)
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a Coffee Order Dataset to uncover sales trends, customer insights, and performance across countries and product categories. The primary objective was to clean and transform raw data, generate meaningful insights using pivot tables, and present the results through an interactive Excel dashboard.
## Business Questions
- How does total coffee sales vary across the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom?
  Insight Enabled By: Sales by Country Chart
- Are coffee sales increasing, declining, or seasonal over time?
- How do different coffee types (Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, Liberica) perform over time?
- Which customers generate the highest revenue?
- Do customers with loyalty cards generate higher sales compared to non-loyalty customers?
- Which roast types (Light, Medium, Dark) generate the highest sales?
- Which product sizes contribute most to total sales?

- Customer ID, Customer Name, Email
- Product ID, Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size
- Quantity, Unit Price
- Country (United States, Ireland, United Kingdom)
- Loyalty Card (Yes/No)
## Tools & Skills USed
- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- Dashboard Design
## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format, and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicers to make dynamic.

## Key Insight
The Coffee Sales analysis shows that revenue is concentrated across specific markets (United States), time periods (2019–2021 peak), customer segments (non-loyalty vs loyalty customers), and product attributes (coffee size and roast type). Total sales for the period analyzed amounted to $45,134, with performance largely driven by the United States, which generated $35,639 (approximately 79%) of total revenue. In comparison, Ireland contributed $6,697 (15%), while the United Kingdom accounted for $2,799 (6%), indicating a heavy dependence on the U.S. market.

Sales performance over time shows gradual growth from 2019 ($12,187) through 2021 ($13,766), which was the highest-performing year, followed by a sharp decline in 2022 ($7,063). Monthly analysis further reveals demand variability, with February 2020 recording the highest monthly sales ($1,798) and August 2022 recording the lowest ($244). This pattern suggests possible seasonality and changing demand conditions over time.

Product performance analysis indicates relatively balanced revenue contribution across coffee types, with Robusta ($12,306), Excelsa ($12,054), and Arabica ($11,768) performing closely, while Liberica generated the lowest sales ($9,005). This suggests diversified customer preferences rather than dependence on a single coffee variety.

Customer segmentation analysis shows that non-loyalty customers generated $24,216 (54%) of total sales, while loyalty customers contributed $20,918 (46%). Although loyalty customers represent a substantial revenue share, non-loyalty customers currently contribute more, highlighting an opportunity to improve loyalty conversion and retention.

Further analysis by roast type reveals that Light roast coffee generated the highest revenue at $17,354, followed by Medium roast ($14,600) and Dark roast ($13,179). Product size analysis shows a strong preference for larger quantities, with 2.5 kg products accounting for $23,789 (over 50% of total sales), while smaller sizes such as 0.2 kg generated $3,308, indicating that bulk purchases are a key revenue driver.
