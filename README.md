# Coffee Sales Analysis and Dashboard (Excel)
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a Coffee Order Dataset to uncover sales trends, customer insights, and performance across countries and product categories. The primary objective was to clean and transform raw data, generate meaningful insights using pivot tables, and present the results through an interactive Excel dashboard.
## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize coffee sales data in order to identify sales trends, top-performing markets, high-value customers, and product preferences using Microsoft Excel.
## Business Questions
- How does total coffee sales vary across the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom?
  Insight Enabled By: Sales by Country Chart
- Are coffee sales increasing, declining, or seasonal over time?
- How do different coffee types (Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, Liberica) perform over time?
- Which customers generate the highest revenue?
- Do customers with loyalty cards generate higher sales compared to non-loyalty customers?
- Which roast types (Light, Medium, Dark) generate the highest sales?
- Which product sizes contribute most to total sales?

## Key Insight
The Coffee Sales analysis shows that total sales of $45,134 are heavily driven by the United States ($35,639, 79%), with Ireland ($6,697, 15%) and the United Kingdom ($2,799, 6%) contributing less. Sales peaked in 2021 ($13,766), with February 2020 as the highest month ($1,798) and August 2022 the lowest ($244), indicating seasonal variations. Coffee type performance was relatively balanced, with Robusta ($12,306), Excelsa ($12,054), and Arabica ($11,768) leading, while Liberica ($9,005) lagged. Non-loyalty customers contributed slightly more revenue ($24,216, 54%) than loyalty customers ($20,918, 46%), suggesting opportunities to strengthen loyalty adoption. Light roast ($17,354) and 2.5 kg products ($23,789) were the top-performing product attributes, highlighting customer preference for lighter roasts and bulk purchases. Overall, the dashboard identifies key markets, products, and customer segments that drive revenue and supports data-driven business decisions.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how sales data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence by identifying where revenue comes from, when it peaks, who drives it, and which products perform best. The analysis confirms that revenue is predominantly driven by U.S. customers, large product sizes (2.5 kg), and Light roast coffee, with peak performance observed between 2019 and 2021.

The findings suggest clear business opportunities, including reducing reliance on a single geographic market, aligning inventory and pricing strategies with high-performing product sizes and roast types, and strengthening loyalty programs to increase repeat purchases. The post-2021 decline in sales also highlights the importance of proactive sales monitoring and demand forecasting.

Overall, the Coffee Sales Dashboard serves as a practical decision-support tool that enables stakeholders to evaluate sales performance across markets, time periods, customer segments, and product attributes, while the project itself demonstrates strong analytical, visualization, and business storytelling skills using Microsoft Excel.
