# Coffee Sales Analysis and Dashboard (Excel)
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a Coffee Order Dataset to uncover sales trends, customer insights, and performance across countries and product categories. The primary objective was to clean and transform raw data, generate meaningful insights using pivot tables, and present the results through an interactive Excel dashboard.
## Business Questions
- How does total coffee sales vary across the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom?
  Insight Enabled By: Sales by Country Chart
- Are coffee sales increasing, declining, or seasonal over time?
- How do different coffee types (Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, Liberica) perform over time?
- Which customers generate the highest revenue?
- Do customers with loyalty cards generate higher sales compared to non-loyalty customers?
- Which roast types (Light, Medium, Dark) generate the highest sales?
- Which product sizes contribute most to total sales?
